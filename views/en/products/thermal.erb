				<p class="black-text justify-align">In many different industrial processes where the production is carried out with heat exchange at high temperatures, conventional methods such as superheated water and steam can meet the requirements. The utilization of water and steam usually implies high operating, maintenance costs and system monitoring requirements due to pre-treatment of process water.</p>
				<p class="black-text justify-align">Thermal Oil Application is an alternative and a cost-effective solution for reaching elevated temperatures at low operating pressures for multiple heat receivers in the process.</p>
